# **Face Recognition Attendance Management System**  
An automated **attendance management system** that uses **face recognition** to mark attendance, developed with Python and OpenCV. This project provides an efficient, secure, and user-friendly solution for managing attendance records.

---

## **Features**
- **Face Recognition:** Automatically captures and recognizes faces for marking attendance.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple GUI using **Tkinter**.
- **Data Storage:** Attendance is saved in `.csv` files and can be stored in a database.
- **Manual Mode:** Allows manual attendance entry when required.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Fast and accurate face detection and recognition.

---

## **Requirements**
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install pillow
pip install pandas
```

**Additional Requirements:**  
- **Tkinter** (pre-installed with Python)  
- **MySQL** (optional, if database storage is required)

---

## **Steps to Run the Project**
1. **Clone or Download Repository:**  
   Download the project repository to your system.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Face-Recognition-Attendance.git
   cd Face-Recognition-Attendance
   ```

2. **Setup Directory Structure:**  
   Create a folder named `TrainingImage` in the project directory.

3. **Update Paths:**  
   Open the `AMS_Run.py` file and update all file paths to match your system's directory structure.

4. **Run the Application:**  
   Run the main script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python AMS_Run.py
   ```

## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Add Face Data**
- Enter your **ID** and **Name** in the provided fields.
- Click the **"Take Images"** button to capture 200 images of your face.
- Images will be saved in the `TrainingImage` folder.

### **2. Train the Model**
- After adding face data, click the **"Train Image"** button.
- This will train the face recognition model using the captured images.
- The trained model is saved in the `TrainingImageLabel` folder.
- Training may take 5–10 minutes for approximately 10 users.

### **3. Mark Attendance**
- Click the **"Automatic Attendance"** button to start face recognition.
- The system will recognize faces and record attendance automatically.
- Attendance is saved as a `.csv` file with a timestamp.

### **4. Manual Attendance (Optional)**
- Use the **"Manually Fill Attendance"** button to record attendance without face recognition.
- Attendance will still be saved in a `.csv` file.

### **Attendance CSV File**
Attendance records are saved with the following format:  
| ID   | Name    | Date       | Time     |  
|------|---------|------------|----------|  
| 101  | John Doe| 2024-12-09 | 09:00 AM |

## **Database Integration (Optional)**
For database storage:  
1. Install WAMP/XAMPP server.  
2. Configure your MySQL database and update connection details in `AMS_Run.py`.  
3. Attendance records will be automatically stored in the database.
